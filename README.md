# Westworld Rescoring Competition
A repository to keep notes and backup files for the Westworld rescoring competition by Spitfire Audio. 

## Sound Design
 - Big dark background drum beat
 - Rising mid-range arp distorted synth
 - Pad: Big moog high arp through paulstretch
 - Percussion: Make high tappy electro percussion with omni
 
 ## Chordal Things
 - At the beginning make chords really long. Shorten them with build. 
 - At hit, stay on 6m/4 chord
 - Later in song, switch to 2 and 3
 
 ## Arrangement
 - Slow down, low pass during high episodes
 - Drop out, piano only during some part (Dolores theme)
 - Embed some westworld themes
 - Fit in character themes
